# Phytoplankton Individual-Based Model (PIBM) 1.0 Readme

This file explains how to run the Phytoplankton Individual-Based Model (PIBM) 1.0 in a one-dimensional (1D) vertical water column. This model consists of an individual-based Lagrangian module, that computes the phytoplankton community, coupled with an Eulerian module that calculates the vertical distribution of the remaining tracers (nutrient, zooplankton and detritus).

The model output has been compared and validated against the observations at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) station.

The published paper describing the model has been accepted by [Geoscientific Model Development](https://gmd.copernicus.org/preprints/gmd-2024-130/).

## Brief summary of the study
The 1D PIBM was developed to analyse the effects of phytoplankton acclimation and diversity on primary production. The Eulerian module computes nutrient, zooplankton and detritus with nitrogen as mass unit. Meanwhile, the Lagrangian module computes the carbon, nitrogen and chlorophyll content of each phytoplankton cell.

The Lagrangian module considers a fixed number of phytoplankton super-individuals, each one associated with a variable number of phytoplankton cells that share identical cell properties (cellular carbon, nitrogen, chlorophyll, etc.). The number of phytoplankton cells per super-individual depends on the associated initial cell size, randomly assigned following a log-uniform distribution between 0.8 and 60 $\mu m$ equivalent spherical diameter (ESD). Then, the number of phytoplankton cells per super-individual varies with time depending on growth and mortality.

Phytoplankton physiological rates are determined by three master traits: (i) Size expressed in terms of the maximal carbon content per cell during its life cycle ($C_{div}$, mmol C cell $^{-1}$); (ii) Optimal temperature ($T_{opt}$, $^\circ C$); and (iii) Light affinity expressed as the initial slope of the Photosynthesis-Irradiance curve ($\alpha^{Chl}$, (W m $^{-2}$) $^{-1}$ (g Chl g C $^{-1}$) $^{-1}$ d $^{-1}$).

Phytoplankton cells are grazed by zooplankton. The Eulerian model resolves a number of (currently 20) zooplankton size classes distributed uniformly in log space from 0.8 to 3600 $\mu m$ ESD. Zooplankton optimal prey (phyto- and zooplankton) size varies allometrically depending on the predator size.

Finally, when a phytoplankton cell reaches the maximum carbon content (equal to twice the initial content), it has a small probability of mutation of the three defined traits (log $C_{div}$, $T_{opt}$ and log $\alpha^{Chl}$) drawn from a Gaussian distribution with a mean equal to the current trait value and a standard deviation.

Currently, the model is configured to simulate the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) station (64.17 $^\circ$ W - 31.67 $^\circ$  N) in the subtropical north-western Atlantic Ocean.

The code developed for this study also includes the options for other more or less complex versions (Model_ID), considering the one developed by Geider et al. (1998) as the "base model". For example, to analyse the variability of the phytoplankton community considering only the light limitation (see below).

To speed up the computation, we use OpenMPI to run the random walk of particles in parallel. In addition, the time step of the biological reaction is set to be 200 times that of random walk.

# Metadata

## Software and packages

The codes are written in Fortran 90. The model codes have been tested in a x86_64 Red Hat linux system using intel fortran or gfortran. The code requires a number of input files (i.e., forcing) to run (see below).

## How to run the code

1. First, it should be checked thar ifort or gfortran compilers are installed on the working machine. To verify the installation, the user can type "ifort -v" or "gfortran -v" in the Terminal window.
	The installation instructions for ifort can be found on https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/get-started-with-fortran-compiler/top.html.
	Those for gfortran can be found on https://fortran-lang.org/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran.

2. On the Terminal window, go to the directory where the model will run (we assume that the root directory is under home directory: ~/).

3. To download the code type: "git clone https://github.com/BingzhangChen/IBM.git".

4. Go to the working directory typing "cd IBM/Run".

5. To change the settings for the model run the file "job-Archie" must be configured. In this file the user can define: (i) "Test = 0" for a fast run, usually for a formal model run for a large number of iterations; or (ii) "Test = 1" to run the model for debugging mode, which is much slower. Moreover, in this file, the user can select the right Fortran compiler to use, and also modify the compiler flags depending on the purpose in the script. The user also needs to correctly specify the NETCDF and openmpi directory. Note that the file "job-Archie" is specifically used on the HPC cluster ARCHIE-WeSt of University of Strathclyde. 

6. Edit the fortran file "params.f90" to specify the parameter values of nu (probability of mutation per birth event per cell) and sigma (standard deviation of mutation of the three traits).

7. To compile the model type "./job-Archie", and an executable (IBM) will be generated.

7. Before running the model, there are two namelist files that the user needs to check and configure. In the file "time.nml" the user can define the time paramters for the model run (more details below). In the file "param.nml" are defined several plankton model parameters (more details below).

8. After defining all the model settings type the preferred command to run the model:

		“./IBM” to simply run the model with only one CPU; some details of the running will be shown on the screen.

		“./IBM \> out” to run the model with only one CPU and save the running details in the “out” file.

		“./IBM \> out & disown” to run the model with only one CPU in the background and save the running details in the “out” file.

		“mpirun -np 5 ./IBM \> out & disown” to run the model with five CPUs in the background and save the running details in the “out” file.
	
	The model will generate a netcdf file with the Eulerian fields named "Eulerian.nc", one netcdf file for each year storing the data of passive particles named "PassY\*.nc", and one netcdf file for every year storing the super-individual data named, "ParY\*.nc".

Here, the user can also define the Model_ID to select del modelling approach of interest.

Here, the user can define the time parameters that establish the total number of simulation days (*NDay_Run*, in days), the time step (*dtsec*, in seconds), and the frequency at which the model outputs will be saved (*nsave*). For example, if the user wants the model outputs to be saved at a daily interval (i.e., every 86400 s), *nsave* should be equal to 86400/*dtsec*.
